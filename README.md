# View JS jQuery Replacement

<p>Seven examples comparing jQuery to VueJS originally from Sarah Drasner.</p>

<p>These are examples from an article by Sarah Drasner in an article entitled: <br>
<i>Replacing jQuery With Vue.js: No Build Step Necessary</i><br>
You can read it here:<br>

<p>I plan to utilize this article in my class examples and thought it would be helpful to have them in a combined repo.</p>
