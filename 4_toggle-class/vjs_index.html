        <!-- Note how the click logic is handled.
        @click is an event handler.
        This is a shorthand for v-on:click=

        The pattern used here is an event passed to ternary operation:
        1.) The click event is evaluated for 'active' or 'non-active'
        2.) The aria-pressed is set to true if active, false if not active.

        WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications or ARIA)
        is a W3C specification for enhancing accessibility in ways that plain HTML cannot.

        aria-pressed indicates that the button behaves similarly to a checkbox,
        in that it has its state toggles between being pressed or unpressed.
